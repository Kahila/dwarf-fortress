Note: Items preceded with an * are copied (more or less, I've edited to make them easier to understand) directly from the book.

I've attempted to pick out all the pertinent information from the book, as far as I've read it, and copied down for your
review any of the passages I deemed useful. The book itself is interesting and informative, but there was a lot of fat
to cut from it--a large section on acqueducts, for example, and a good deal of information about gynacology etc. etc.
--things that I didn't think would make the cut, and figured you might appreciate being spared.

I've added notes and wikilinks throughout, to clarify things, and gave a few opinions/suggestions that I hope might be helpful (I've tried to avoid making any of them personal, but there are a few where I felt my perspective might be slightly relevant-feel free to ignore it), and added definitions for some of the most esoteric/out of date/bizarre terms, and language uses.



'Outlines of Greek and Roman Medicine' by James Sands Elliott: The Dwarfnotes version.



*Offices of priest and of medicine-man were often combined in one person, in ancient times

*Many remedies were learned from observing animals, and from discovering the medicinal properties of plants, while searching for food-sources.

An Etruscan work, the 'Twelve Tables of Numa', makes references to dental operations

(ROMAN DEITIES) Febris was the god of fever, Mephitis the god of stench; Fessonia aided the weary, and "Sweet Cloacina" presided over the drains. The plague-stricken appealed to the goddess Angeronia, women to Fluonia and Uterina. Ossipaga took care of the bones of children, and Carna was the deity presiding over the abdominal organs.

Early prescriptions were derived from the Sibylline books.

*By order of the Sibylline books, in 399 B.C., the first 'Lectisternium' was held in Rome to combat a pestilence. This was a festival of Greek origin. It was a time of prayer and sacrifice; the images of the gods were laid upon a couch, and a meal was spread on a table before them. These festivals were repeated as occasion demanded, and the device of driving a nail into the temple of Jupiter to ward off "the pestilence that walketh in darkness," and "destruction that wasteth at noonday" was begun 360 B.C.

*After the Battle of Sutrium (309 B.C.) more soldiers died of wounds than were killed in action. The worship of Æsculapius was begun by the Romans 291 B.C., and the Egyptian Isis and Serapis were also invoked for their healing powers.

Note: Just because they're not *your* gods, doesn't mean you can't appeal to them, when you're sick.

*Temple of Æsculapius, which was built after (the great Roman) plague in 291 B.C., was situated on the island of the Tiber. Tradition states that, when the Tarquins were expelled, their crops were thrown into the river, and soil accumulated thereon until ultimately the island was formed. In consequence of the strange happening of the serpent landing from the ship the end of the island on which the Temple of Æsculapius stood was shaped into the form of the bow of a ship, and the serpent of Asculapius was sculptured upon it in relief.

Note: Serpents are frequently referenced, in ancient times, in connection with medicine/knowledge, as well as death/poison. Also, it was a common belief that what was considered poisonous, might also hold the key to the cure.

*It was the custom for patients to sleep under the portico of the Temple of Æsculapius, hoping that the god of the healing art might inspire them in dreams as to the system of cure they should adopt for their illnesses.

*The Church of St. Bartholomew now stands on the ruins of the Temple of Æsculapius.

Note: Belief that proximity to a temple of healing, itself, might inspire a cure. Also, as an aside--holy sites/healing sites, historically, often remain holy after a temple's destruction, or even the destruction of the original faith.

*The doctors of Ancient Rome took no regular course of study, nor were any standards specified, but as a rule knowledge was acquired by pupilage to a practising physician, for which a honorarium was paid.

*Subsequently the 'Archiatri' (basically, the chief medical examiners), after the manner of trade guilds, received apprentices, but Pliny had cause to complain of the system of medical education, or rather, to deplore the want of it.

*Pliny wrote: "People believed in anyone who gave himself out for a doctor, even if the falsehood directly entailed the greatest danger. Unfortunately, there is no law which punishes doctors for ignorance, and no one takes revenge on a doctor if through his fault someone dies. It is permitted him by our danger to learn for the future, at our death to make experiments, and, without having to fear punishment, to set at naught the life of a human being."

Note: Here's a wikiarticle about medical personnel/the medical community of ancient Rome:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_community_of_ancient_Rome

Note: No laws regulating doctors existed in the time of Pliny the Elder. Infact, him actually pointing that out doesn't seem to have changed much, not very quickly anyway.

*Before the time when Greek doctors settled in Rome, medical treatment was mainly under the direct charge of the head of each household. The father of a family had great powers conferred upon him by the Roman law, and was physician as well as judge over his family

In ancient times, there was a considerable amount of knowledge of sanitation. The great sewer of Rome, the Cloaca Maxima, which drained the swampy valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, was built by order of Tarquinius Priscus in 616 B.C.

*(HEALING SPRING NEAR CAMPAGNA): Near this place there is a spring of milky-looking water containing sulphurous acid, sulphurated lime, and bicarbonate of lime, used now, and in ancient times for the relief of skin complaints. This water, at the present day, has an almost constant temperature of 75°.

On a Roman campaign, every soldier carried on his person a field-dressing, and the wounded received rough-and-ready first-aid attention from their comrades in arms.

Note: The soldiers at this time took care of themselves/each other, no combat medics at this time, apparently?

*The history of healing begins in the Hellenic mythology with Apollo, the god of light and the promoter of health. In the "Iliad" he is hailed as the disperser of epidemics, and, in this respect, the ancients were well informed in attributing destruction of infection to the sun's rays

Note: Sunlight considered healthy (unless you're a dwarf). Sunlight impedes/destroys disease.

*Amid much that is mythological in the history of Æsculapius, there is a groundwork of facts. Splendid temples were built to him in lovely and healthy places, usually on a hill or near a spring; they were visited by the sick, and the priests of the temples not only attended to the worship of Æsculapius, but took pains to acquire knowledge of the healing art. The chief temple was at Epidaurus, and here the patients were well provided with amusements, for close to the temple was a theatre capable of seating 12,000 people, and a stadium built to accommodate 20,000 spectators.

*Tradition states that when Æsculapius was in the house of his patient, Glaucus, and deep in thought, a serpent coiled itself around his staff. Æsculapius killed it, and then another serpent appeared with a herb leaf in its mouth, and restored the dead reptile to life. It seems probable that disease was looked upon as a poison. Serpents produced poison, and had a reputation in the most ancient times for wisdom, and for the power of renovation, and it was thought that a creature which could produce poison and disease might probably be capable of curing as well as killing. Serpents were kept in the Temples of Æsculapius, and were non-poisonous and harmless. They were given their liberty in the precincts of the temple, but were provided with a serpent-house or den near to the altar. They were worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and were fed by the sick at the altar with "popana," or sacrificial cakes.

*Melampus was considered by the Greeks the first mortal to practise healing. In one case he prescribed rust, probably the earliest use of iron as a drug, and he also used hellebore (a herbacious flower) root as a purgative.

*Unguents (A soothing preparation spread on wounds, burns, rashes, abrasions or other topical injuries. It is similar to an ointment, though typically an unguent is less viscous and more oily) and astringents (chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical medicinal application. Ex: Witch Hazel) were in use in the physician's art, and there is reference to "nepenthe," a narcotic drug, and also to the use of sulphur as a disinfectant.

*Doctors, according to Homer (Illiad/Odyssey), were held in high esteem, and 'Arctinus' relates that two divisions were recognized, surgeons and physicians, the former held in less honour than the latter--"Then Æsculapius bestowed the power of healing upon his two sons; nevertheless, he made one of the two more celebrated than the other; on one did he bestow the lighter hand that he might draw missiles from the flesh, and sew up and heal all wounds; but the other he endowed with great precision of mind, so as to understand what cannot be seen, and to heal seemingly incurable diseases."

Note: Although both were respected, surgeons were less "honored" than physicians, traditionally. This gap has often existed, and still exists today, to a limited extent.

Note: Book makes reference to a Machaon (possibly a combat medic), who extracted a barbed arrow, sucked the wound, and applied a secret ointment to it.

*Tablets were affixed to the walls of healing temples recording the name of the patient, the disease and the cure prescribed. There is evidence that diseases were closely observed. The patients brought gifts to the temples, and underwent a preliminary purification by ablutions, fasting, prayer and sacrifice. A rooster was a common sacrifice to the god. No doubt many wonderful cures were effected. Mental suggestion was used greatly, and the patient was put to sleep, his cure being often revealed to him in a dream which was interpreted by the priests. The expectancy
of his mind, and the reduced state of his body as the result of abstinence conduced to a cure, and trickery also played a minor part.

*Albeit, much of the treatment prescribed was commendable. Pure air, cheerful surroundings, proper diet and temperate habits were advocated, and, among other methods of treatment, exercise, massage, sea-bathing,
the use of mineral waters, purgatives and emetics, and hemlock as a sedative, were in use. If a cure was not effected, the faith of the patient was impugned, and not the power of the god or the skill of the Asclepiades, so that neither religion nor the practice of physic was exposed to discredit.

Note the refined use of emotional/psychological factors in healing, in ancient times. Compare to some of the creepy, poorly lit, industrially stagnant/sterile environments of many modern hospitals.

Note: Pre-'Hippocratic Oath': *a high ethical standard was attained, as is shown by the oath prescribed for students when they completed their course of study.

*The ancient Greek Gymnasia were in use long before the Asclepiades began to practise in the temples. The Greeks were a healthy and strong race, mainly because they attended to physical culture as a national duty. The attendants who massaged the bodies of the athletes were called 'Aliptæ', and they also taught physical exercises, and practised minor surgery and medicine.

*Massage was used before and after exercises in the gymnasium, and was performed by anointing the body with a mixture of oil and sand which was well rubbed into the skin. There were three classes of officials in the gymnasia; the director or magistrate called the 'Gymnasiarch', the sub-director or 'Gymnast', and the subordinates. The directors regulated the diet of the young men, the sub-directors, besides other duties, prescribed for the sick, and the attendants massaged, bled, dressed wounds, and treated abscesses, dislocations.

The transgression of some of Solon's (Solon the Wise) laws in reference to the gymnasia was punishable by death.

*In the practice of medicine, Pythagorus promoted health mainly by diet and gymnastics, advised music for depression of spirits, and had in use various vegetable drugs. He introduced 'xymel of squills'(Note: "Oxymel" is a mixture of vinegar and honey, and squills are a type of medicinal sea onion/lily) from Egypt into Greece, and was a strong believer in the medicinal properties of onions.

*He viewed surgery with disfavour, and used only salves and poultices (A poultice is a soft moist mass, often heated and medicated, that is spread on cloth over the skin to treat an aching, inflamed, or painful part of the body.).

*The Asclepiades treated patients in the temples, but the Pythagoreans visited from house to house, and from city to city, and were known as the ambulant or periodic physicians. (Note: In other words, they made housecalls. They might have made a broad circuit, visiting many different households, and then coming back to them, like a kind of medical "caravan".)

*'Leucippus' and 'Democritus', rejecting theology, considered vital action secondary to the operation of the laws of matter, and believed that atoms moved through pores in the body in such a way as to determine a state of health or disease.

Hippocrates--father of medicine:

*The central principle of belief of Hippocrates and the Dogmatists (a medical sect) was that health depended on the proper proportion and action in the body of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and the four cardinal humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. The due combination of these was known as 'crasis', and existed in health. If a disease were progressing, these humours became changed and combined (an event called a "Coction"), preparatory to the expulsion of the morbid matter (called a "Crisis"), which took place at definite periods known as critical days. Hippocrates also held the theory of fluxions, which were conditions in the nature of congestion (Note: congestion of these "humours", I'm assuming, as well as sinus congestion, heart congestion, things like that, maybe?), as it would now be understood.

*In his time public opinion condemned dissection of the human body, but it is certain that dissections were performed by Hippocrates to a limited extent. He did not know the difference between the arteries and the veins, and nerves and ligaments and various membranes were all thought to have analogous functions, but his writings display a correct knowledge of the anatomy of certain parts of the body such as the joints and the brain.

*Hippocratic classification of diseases into sporadic, epidemic, and endemic (Note: endemic=maintained by a population, without input of disease-carriers from outside. Diseases may also be genetic, but he didn't know that.), and he also separated 'acute' (meaning having a short duration) from 'chronic' (recurring) diseases. He divided the causes of disease into two classes: general, such as climate, water and sanitation; and personal, such as improper food and neglect of exercise.

He based his conclusions on the observation of appearances: The state of the face, eyes, tongue, voice, hearing, abdomen, sleep, breathing, excretions, posture of the body, and so on, all aided him in diagnosis and prognosis.

Pharmaceuticals used by Hippocrates--

Narcotics: mandragora (mandrake root, all parts of the plant are poisonous), henbane (stinking nightshade, psychoactive), and probably also poppy-juice.

Laxatives: A vegetable substance called "mercury," beets, and cabbage.

Cathartics (body cleansers): scammony (a flowering bindweed) and elaterium (a relative of the cucumber).

Hemlock (another poison, used for executions) was also used as a sedative.

Note: Deadly Nightshade, Datura (aka 'thorn apple'), and Brugmansia (aka 'angels trumpets') are three other plant narcotics. Deadly Nightshade, while it is extremely poisonous, has occasionally been used as a recreational drug, believe it or not. Both plants are known for inducing extremely bad, "train wreak" type nightmare hallucinations-Datura is thought to be the worst of the three-and all three are highly toxic, with a host of other nasty symptoms (memory loss, severe pupil dilation lasting several days-with resultant clinical photophobia, rapid heartbeat, heat stroke.).

These are all anticholinergic drugs. For a full list of symptoms:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic

*He was able to diagnose fluid in the chest or abdomen by means of percussion (tapping on the chest) and auscultation (listening to the chest, via stethiscope or otherwise), and to withdraw the fluid by the operation of paracentesis (draining fluid from a body-cavity with a long needle), and he recognized also that the fluid should be allowed to flow away slowly so as to minimize the risk of syncope (fainting/loss of consciousness). He operated also for empyema (the formation of pus in an existing body-cavity).

*Hippocrates prescribed fluid diet for fevers, allowed the patients cold water or barley water to drink, and recommended cold sponging for high fever.

Note: A precedent for no alchohol.

*In his writings will be found his views on: apoplexy (seizure/extreme rage, also can mean bleeding of the internal organs. Historically, the word "apoplexy" was also used to describe any sudden death that began with a sudden loss of consciousness, especially one where the victim died within a matter of seconds after losing consciousness.), epilepsy, phthisis (tuberculosis), gout (IMO: Gout seems to me like something that could be especially interesting for dwarfs to suffer from, as it's an arthritis caused by crystals forming in the bloodstream:) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout

erysipelas (an acute skin infection caused by streptococcus), cancer and many other diseases common at the present day.

*Hippocrates prescribed lotions for the healing of ulcers; some of these lotions were antiseptic.

*His treatment for fractures was sound, and he considered it "disgraceful" for a surgeon to set a bone badly.

*He resected the projecting ends of the
bone in the case of compound fracture.

*He had a very complete knowledge of the anatomy of joints, was well acquainted with hip-joint disease, and could operate upon joints.

*Hippocrates:
understood the causation of club-foot, and could cure cases of this deformity by bandaging. He was skillful also in obstetric operations (operations on pregnant women, or immediately after childbirth). He trepanned the skull, which appears to have been a common operation in his day. He had clear and sound views in reference to wounds of the head, recognizing that trivial-looking wounds of the scalp might become very serious. Hippocrates gave directions as to the indications for using the trepan, and warned the operator against mistaking sutures of the cranial bones for fracture.

*He did not describe amputations as generally understood, but removed limbs at a joint for gangrene. When necessary he made use of mechanical appliances for reducing dislocations, and recommended doctors to furnish their surgeries with an adjustable table, fitted with levers, for dealing with the reduction of dislocations, and for various other surgical manipulations. Excision of tumours was not a common operation of Hippocratic surgery, although it had been a part of Hindu practice in very ancient times. On the subject of Obstetrics, Hippocrates wrote a great deal, and although many of his theories seem absurd at the present day, yet, on the whole, the treatment he recommends is efficacious.

Note: (He also treated diabetes, in a somewhat holistic manner)

Quote from Hippocrates:

"Instruction in medicine is like the culture of the productions of the earth. For our natural disposition is, as it were, the soil; the tenets of our teacher are, as it were, the seed; instruction in youth is like the planting of the seed in the ground at the proper season; the place where the instruction is communicated is like the food imparted to vegetables by the atmosphere; diligent study is like the cultivation of the fields; and it is time which imparts strength to all things and brings them to maturity.

Plato:

*Elaborated on the humoral pathology of Hippocrates. The world, he thought, was composed of four elements: Fire--consisting of pyramidal atoms, Earth--of cubical atoms, Air--of octagonal atoms, and Water--of twenty-sided atoms. The marrow consists of triangles, and the brain is the perfection of marrow. The soul dominates the marrow and the separation of the two causes death. The purpose of the bones and muscles is to protect the marrow against changes of temperature. Plato divided the "soul" into three parts: Reason, enthroned in the brain; courage in the heart; and desire in the liver. The uterus, he believed, excites inordinate desires. Inflammations are due to disorders of the bile, and fevers to the influence of the elements. His theories in regard to the special senses are very fantastic, for instance, smell is evanescent because it is not founded on any external image; taste results from small vessels carrying taste atoms to the heart and soul.

Note: Plato had the brain right, whereas Aristotle thought it was pretty inimportant.

Note: Plato also has the soul located in the marrow, culminating in the brain (reason), but further subdivided into the heart (courage), desire (liver), and I guess passion? (uterus).

The Egyptians also subdivided the soul, in their case, into 5 parts, separate from the body:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_soul#Ka_.28life_force.29


Aristotle:

*Aristotle pointed out the differences in the anatomy of men and monkeys; he described the anatomy of the elephant and of birds, and also the changes in development seen during the incubation of eggs. He investigated, also, the anatomy of fishes and reptiles. The stomachs of ruminant animals excited his interest, and he described their structure. The heart, according to Aristotle, was the seat of the soul, and the birthplace of the passions, for it held the natural fire, and in it centered movement, sensation and nourishment. The diaphragm, he believed, separated the heart, the seat of the soul, from the contaminating influences of the intestines. He did not advance beyond the conception that nerves were akin to ligaments and tendons, and he believed that the nerves originated in the heart, as did also the blood-vessels. He named the 'Aorta' and 'Ventricles'. He investigated the action of the muscles.

*The Asclepiadæ of Cos and Cnidos had discoursed upon the phenomena of disease, without attempting to demonstrate its structural relations; like the sculptors of their own age, they studied the changing expression of vital action almost wholly from an external point of view. They meddled not with the dead, for, by their own laws, no one was allowed to die within the temple. But the early Alexandrians were subject to no such restrictions; and turning to good account the discoveries of Aristotle in natural history and comparative anatomy, they undertook for the first time to describe the organization of the
human frame from actual dissections.

Note: Preservation of the sacred by not allowing death to occur in a holy place, and yet their priests undertook dissection. Suggestive of a separation between living (holy) flesh that must be preserved alive in the holy temple, and dead flesh sans soul?

*Medical practice became so flourishing at Alexandria that three great specialities were established, namely, Surgery, Pharmacy, and Dietetics, and a great variety of operations were performed. Lithotomy (removal of kidney/bladder stones) was much practised by specialists. A foul murder was perpetrated by lithotomists at the instigation of Diodotus, the guardian of Antiochus, son of Alexander, King of Syria (150 B.C.), young Antiochus, at the age of 10, being done to death under the pretence that he had a stone in his bladder.

*About 150 B.C. a sect called the 'Essenes' was established for the study of curative and poisonous substances. The members were not all physicians, by any means, for one of their chief members was King Mithridates

*Two famous physicians and anatomists, 'Herophilus' (335-280 B.C.) and 'Erasistratus' (280 B.C.) took part in the medical teaching at Alexandria in the early days of that seat of learning. It is recorded that they did not confine their investigations to the dissection of the dead, but also vivisected criminals.

*Erasistratus and Herophilus, it is sad to relate, considered that vivisection of human beings, as well as dissection of the dead, was a necessary part of medical education, and
believed that the sufferings of a few criminals did not weigh against the benefit likely to accrue to innocent people, who could be relieved or cured of disease and suffering as the result of the knowledge gained by dissection of the living. This cruel and nefarious practice was followed "so that the investigators could study the particular organs during life in regard to position, colour, form, size, disposition, hardness, softness, smoothness, and superficial extent, their projection and curvatures."

*'Chrysippos' introduced the practice of emptying a limb of blood before amputation, according to the recent method of Esmarch, and is said to have employed vapour baths in
the treatment of dropsy.
