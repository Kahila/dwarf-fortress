Base categories

CLEAR vs NOISY
FULL vs THIN
ROUND vs SHARP
SMOOTH vs CHOPPY
STEADY vs EVOLVING


Each instrument gets one or more timbres, each one being specified fully in those five categories.  A timbre is described by a collection of adjectives that cover all of its base categories.  The basic loudness/pitch is not part of this, nor is the frequency range.

A new instrument might have a "noisy, thin, sharp, choppy, evolving" timbre, which the game can compress to any of "shrill, evolving", "wispy, choppy", "buzzy, quavering", "nasal, sharp, evolving", or "harsh, thin, evolving".  We don't need adjectives for all 32 of the combinations, since most of the adjectives are neutral to some categories so a non-conflicting combo phrase can do the full lift together.  We always have the 10 base adjectives to fall back on if few good combinations exist.

Some instruments have multiple timbres because they have several registers (frequency ranges where they are qualitatively different).  An instrument's overall timbre describes the categories shared by all registers (if such overlap exists).  For instance, a flute might have a "clear, full" timbre overall, even though it can sound piercing, sonorous or quavering at different registers.  The flute's register adjective collections all imply "clear" and "full" somewhere (quavering is neutral to both, so full would need to be added, like "the low register has a strong, round, quavering timbre", where strong = clear + full).
